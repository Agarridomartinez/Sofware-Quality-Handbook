# Sofware-Quality-Handbook

This repository contains examples of how to write lesible and functional code in Java. It is based on the SQM.docx document that explains in detail why one should follow these set of rules.
# CodingPractices
This example contains simple guidelines on how to write lesible code. It focues on:
  - Correctly defining class names
  - Naming variables accordingly
  - Naming constants accodringly
  - How to write proper getters and setters
  - Interface names
  - Necessity of overriding the equals() and hashCode() functions.


You can also:
  - Use the "checkstyles" tool to validate these standards.

# UnitTestingExample
This example contains a JUnit test that validates if a number is prime
  - Intentionally broken "isPrime" function
  - One JUnit test for numbers smaller than 5
  - Another JUnit test for numbers larger than 5
  - View a runnable example of a failed test
  
You can also:
  - Try to fix the broken implementation with the help of Unit Tests!
  

## Tools used to validate the examples
* [JUnit] - JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests.
* [checkstyle] - Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task.
